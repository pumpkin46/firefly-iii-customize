A note about new translations: text you see in errors and emails may still be in English. This is not a bug. Translated text is sometimes generated outside of
 what's called the user's "session". When Firefly III operates outside of your session, it can't access your preferences or your data. It doesn't know what
  language to pick. You can set the `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`-environment variable. But user specific preferences may be ignored.

## 4.8.2-alpha.1 (API 0.10.5) - 2019-11-03

Normally I won't be detailling alpha versions in the changelog but this is a 
special one. If your Firefly III installation warned you that this version has 
been released, please take note that this is a **test** version and may **not** 
be stable!

### Changed
- Firefly III now comes in three channels: stable, beta and alpha. You can 
  find the latest version for each channel on [this website](https://version.firefly-iii.org/).
- To make sure your Docker instance logs everything to `stdout`, make sure 
  you set the environment variable `LOG_CHANNEL` to `docker_out`. This is now 
  default behavior for new installations that use the `.env` file to launch 
  Firefly III (using Docker compose), but if you use environment variables 
  you may have to set this yourself. This is not a mandatory change but will 
  make debugging easier.
- The Docker image is now also available in AArch64.
